Marvel Champions Repository to play solo runs on PlayingCards.io
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO PLAY ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL:DR
1. Import the room 'marvelchampionsV1.pcio' on PlayingCards.io
2. Edit the decks in 'Edit Table' mode and add the cards you need! 
3. That's everything! Have fun! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Import 'marvelchampionsV1.pcio'

Simply create a 'custom room' on PlayingCards.io mainpage. Then pick 'Start Blank Room'. You click 'Edit Table' to find the 'Room Options' menu.
In the settings you can import a file, you need to import 'marvelchampionsV1.pcio' (Found in the main 'MarvelChampions' folder)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Edit the decks 

When you first enter the room, there is no deck on the table, that is normal. The decks are there but they are all empty!
You need to, again, enter 'Edit Table' mode, you will see the decks now, I have put some text to help you know which one is which. (The Villain deck is in the Villain Deck Holder)

Click on the Deck, then 'Edit Deck'
The deck already has the right configuration you only need to go straight to the 'Cards' tab. 
I use https://marvelcdb.com/ to make my deck before-hand, then, with CTRL-F, I add the cards I need.

Deck Customization can take some time, so after setting up your hero decks, you can 'Export Room' to save the room as it is with your Hero deck fully ready!

Thank you for playing, hope you have fun out there!
